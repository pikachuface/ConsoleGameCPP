# Snake game that runs in **Console**

## How to setup the app

There are two directories in which you can find the build script for **CMake**:
- Linux
- Windows
---
## **Linux**

Go to the _Linux_ folder and run the _Build.sh_
Then go to the _ConsoleGameCPP/Build_ folder which was created by the script and run:
```sh
make 
```
And with that you should see the **ConsoleGameCPP binary** somewhere in the _Build_ folder.

---
## **Windows**

On windows you can choose between **MinGW**or **MS Visual Studio**.

- **MinGW(gcc)**
<br>
Run the _BuildGCC.bat_ which will crate and build the _gcc_ solution.
Then just go to the _ConsoleGameCPP/Build folder_ and somewhere in the folder you should be able to see the **ConsoleGameCPP.exe**

- **MS Visual Studio(.sln)**
<br>
 Run the _MakeSln.bat_ which will crate _MS Visual Studio 2019_ solution.
Then just go to the _ConsoleGameCPP/Build folder_ and somewhere in the folder you should be able to see the **ConsoleGameCPP.sln** which you just open in Visual Studio in which you can build the app.
