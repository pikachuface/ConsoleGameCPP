# Snake game that runs in Console

**info**: the game is **not** completed

## Setup the game
- **GCC Windows/Linux**

- You will need to have gcc installed and the working directory should be the folder with .cpp files
- Then you just write these commands and the game will be compiled
- Depending on your system there should be file called Snakegame.exe/.o and that is your binary

```bash
$ gcc -c *.cpp 
$ gcc -c *.c
$ gcc -o Snakagame *.o
```
If *.cpp doesnt work you will need to write the files **separately**.

---

- **Visual Studio Windows**

- You will need to have Visual Studio installed with C++ SDK
- When you have Visual Studio installed all you need to do is make new C++ project and then copy all the files in your project and run the program

**enjoy**
